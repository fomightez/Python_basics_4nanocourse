However, sometimes you may want to run those steps at one point in the whole list of steps and then maybe again later, not in that same loop. Or what if you write something you use quite often in many different scripts or notebooks with different data and slightly different options.\n",

And then you define a list of steps to run on input passed into those parameters when you call that function. Optionally, you can also have the function return something, such as a result when it is done. For example, if it was doing a calculation you can have it return the calculated value and assign that to a variable, or append it to a list or dictionary where you are collecting the results.\n",
