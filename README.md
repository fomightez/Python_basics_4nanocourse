# Python_basics_4nanocourse

Python basics continued for Upstate Medical Spring 2020 nanocourse.

Continues from [here](https://github.com/fomightez/Python_basics_on_PDB_file)

Python basics contined for session #5 of [Upstate Medical University's **GS647-021 Nanocourse: Structuring against Coronavirus**](https://github.com/fomightez/UpstateGS647-021Nanocourse/wiki)

## Looking for the slideshow you recall?

The content for the slideshow is in the file `index.ipynb`. It won't display in sessions launched from here as a slideshow. The slideshow presentation mode was done for the class session using a different repository in order to have it open automatically in slide mode and limit dependencies slightly. The slideshow works from [here](https://github.com/fomightez/Python_basics_4nanocourseRISE).

## Guidance on what you'll see in the sessions launched from here

Needed?

## Technical details

Originally based on [this repo](https://github.com/fomightez/BVCN-Jupyter_base) combining [the jupyter-offlinenotebook extension to enable saving notebooks to local-storage](https://github.com/manics/jupyter-offlinenotebook) and [the JupyterLab Visual Debugger](https://github.com/jupyterlab/debugger), where also the Table of Contents extension was added, see [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-toc#jupyterlab-toc).  
However, the offline notebook has now been integrated into JupyterLab on Binder, and in fact the Table of Contents viewer is now built-in. And so the build process can now be streamlined wish signficant speed-up. Recently, [the JupyterLab Visual Debugger](https://github.com/jupyterlab/debugger) as also been built in; however, is not implemented here yet. [From here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/debugger#jupyterlabdebugger) that would require using an `environment.yml` and so I haven't built it back in yet, as I don't know if it is worth it right now as it requires switching the kernel around and I don't think I left directions for that in here(?).
